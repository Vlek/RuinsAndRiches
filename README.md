# Ruins & Riches

This is a single-player focused version of the game Ultima Online that seeks
to give an RPG experience using the Ultima Online game but with special
scripts supplied in the server files for a customized look and feel.

These are my script files that take the September 22nd, 2022 release from
the creator and added my own spin onto it that I believe makes it more
enjoyable to play.

# Compile project

## Linux + Mac(?):

Just use the `make` command while in the parent directory of the project to run
mono's make against the files.

## Windows:

I believe `dotnet build` might work, but haven't tried.
