Tributes for resurrection will cost double the amount, perhaps forcing you to resurrect with penalties. You will not be allowed to enter any civilized areas, unless you perhaps find a way to disguise yourself. The exceptions are some public areas like inns, taverns, and banks.

The reason for this is that you are wanted for murder. You may have actually committed the act, or you could have simply been framed. The murder was against a very powerful figure, so the many lands will never forgive the deed. Whether truth or falsehood, that is up to you to tell. Do with your life what you will. You can live a life of criminal pursuits, or you can destroy the evil that lurks in the darkest places of the land.

Your adventure will begin as a barbarian in the Savaged Empire, which is one of the most difficult lands in the realms. It is filled with many dangerous animals and colossal dinosaurs. There are no safe places to hunt for food, which also means practicing your combat skills is equally dangerous. You will, however, begin with some leather armor that will help you surive the dangers away from the settlements. You will also begin with a talisman that will aid you in camping and cooking, so you can live off of the land better. Additional gold, food, and bandages will be provided as well as a steel dagger and a durable camping tent. Any dungeons you dare enter will be more deadly than those in Sosaria, so take some great consideration before deciding this path.

With the space station plummeting to Sosaria, due to the Stranger draining the fuel reserves, the doctor decided to place your stasis chamber onto their last medical shuttle craft. They set it on auto-pilot and hoped for the best. It landed safely on Sosaria where you could continue your life on this primitive world. You may have an advantage as you are from a more advanced race of beings, so you have the ability to remember and learn more things (can grandmaster 40 different skills).<br><br>Because of your advanced knowledge of logic and science, however, some things learned about Sosaria is that they have elements you cannot fully understand. Magical resurrection, and the concept of deities, are things you cannot comprehend (costs 3 times as much gold to resurrect at a shrine or healer). The system shock from any such resurrection would surely take its toll (paying full tribute still causes a 10% loss in fame and karma, and a 5% loss in skills and attributes) which could prove to be devastating (paying no tribute at all would cause a 20% loss in fame and karma, and a 10% loss in skills and attributes).<br><br>Although you will be able to learn some of the skills that are classified as magic or divine, you will surely justify it with science. Because of your lack of superstition, unlike the inhabitants of this world, you don’t believe in the concept of luck (you will never benefit from luck). You do not have any of Sosaria's currency to barter with (you begin with no gold), and because you feel you are more advanced, you will probably not get along with the guildmasters of the crude trades they practice (guild membership costs 4 times as much as normal).<br><br>If you choose this fate, then you will appear at your crashed shuttle craft where your adventure begins. You can use the nearby computer terminal to change your skin and hair tones if you want an appearance that is slightly different than human, due to your alien heritage.<br><br>When you awake, you will have no memory of who you were. You will find yourself near the shuttle that crashed on top of the mountain. The computer system instructed you on how to setup a power source from the remaining fuel, and it appeared that an alien creature latched onto the shuttle and died in the crash. You have been using this as a source of food and have survived a few days from it. Now your supplies are running out, your canteen is empty, and all you have is a knife.
